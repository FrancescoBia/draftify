# Draftify

Draftify is a minimal note and journal app (Mac only). It's a place to quickly write ideas and to think.

Rather than for creating perfect notes, Draftify aims to be a place for your unfinished thoughts and drafts. Every day you're given a blank canvas for your ideas, or to-do lists (it supports Markdown formatting, which includes checklists). On the other page, you can see the older notes from past days, and edit/review them.
